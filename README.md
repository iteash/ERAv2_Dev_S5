# Readme.md for NN Convolution and Fully connected Layer model

This file give details of the files present in this git folder for running the NN Convolution and Fully connected Layer model 

* **model.py** - This stores a class Net() which defines the structure of the Neural Network.
* **utils.py** - This file defines the function which trains the model with training datsets and calculate the loss and predicts the output. Similarly it has a function for test data. With both the functions we calculate loss and accuracy and modify the model to get the results closer to the actual result. 
* **S5.ipynb** - This file has the code for data download, data loader, data transforms, data plotting, defining the structure of the model and calculating the loss function and accuracy.
